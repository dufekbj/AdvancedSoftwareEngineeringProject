Project Title:
EvoBug – A Genetic Algorithm for Killing Mutants in LeetCode Programs
Introduction
This proposal outlines a project aimed at developing EvoBug, a genetic algorithm (GA) designed to enhance the
effectiveness of mutation testing in software development. By leveraging evolutionary techniques, we aim to optimize
test inputs to improve code coverage and detect software vulnerabilities more efficiently than traditional methods.
Motivation
Mutation testing serves as a critical measure of test suite quality. Current approaches often rely heavily on random
input generation, which may not effectively exploit the potential of existing test cases. EvoBug seeks to address this
gap by utilizing an evolutionary strategy to make the testing process both dynamic and visually impactful.
Problem Statement
The primary problem our team aims to solve is the inefficiency of existing mutation testing methodologies that often
fall short in maximizing mutation scores. These methodologies typically do not leverage advanced techniques, leading to
lower detection rates of mutant programs.
Proposed Work
Our approach involves the development of a genetic algorithm that evolves test inputs specifically designed to maximize
the percentage of mutants killed. The insights gained from this will be further elucidated through:
1.	Selecting 3–5 short Python/Java functions from LeetCode.
2.	Utilizing a mutation testing tool (e.g., MutPy or PIT) to inject mutants.
3.	Implementing a GA in Python that generates input vectors optimized for killing these mutants.
4.	Evaluating our GA's effectiveness by comparing it against random input generation techniques.
Techniques
•       Genetic Algorithm (GA) will be the backbone of our project. We will implement genetic operators such as
selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the test inputs.
•	Mutation Testing Tools will be used to create a robust set of mutational variants for evaluation.
Evaluation Plan
The effectiveness of EvoBug will be assessed by:
•	Comparing the mutation scores achieved through the GA against those from random testing.
•	Documenting and visualizing improvements in mutant kills over multiple generations.
Feasibility
Given the timeline, we will structure our milestones as follows:
•       Week 1-2 (Nov 3 - 17): Literature review of genetic algorithms and mutation testing techniques. Initial setup
and testing of selected functions.
•	Week 3 (Nov 18 - Dec 1): Implementation of the GA and mutation testing tool. Initial tests on selected functions.
•	Dec 2: Run extensive evaluations and begin compiling results.
•	Dec 3: Prepare presentation materials based on findings.
Deliverables
At the conclusion of the project, we aim to deliver:
•       A comprehensive GitHub repository containing the code, mutant reports, and visualizations illustrating fitness
improvement per generation.
•       A 3-page report addressing the research question: “Can genetic algorithms outperform random testing at mutation
killing?”
